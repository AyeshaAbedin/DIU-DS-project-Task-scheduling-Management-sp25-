# 📅 Task Scheduling System

A console-based task scheduling application written in C, designed to manage daily tasks through a structured, user-friendly interface. This project simulates a basic scheduling system with features like user login, task addition, editing, deletion, and file-based storage. Developed as part of a university assignment where I led a team and handled the overall system design and functionality.
